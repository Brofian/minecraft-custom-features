# Current list of features

### Auto-Placing
This allows pots to be crafted into auto-placeable pots. These will be placed
once they exist as an item in the world. This allows for games with automated
pot replacements via the crafter.

### Item-Magnet
Craft your very own item magnet with a breeze rod, an iron ingot and a blaze rod!
Holding the magnet will pull nearby items to you. But make sure you can hold them all...

### Paintball
This changes the behavior of rockets to function as paintball guns:
- Rockets cannot be fired normally, they will drop instead
- Rockets fired from a crossbow will paint concrete on impact
- Rockets placed by shift clicking will become mines that activate by contact or after a certain time

A feature for restricting this to a specific area is partially implemented, but does not change the rockets right now

### Chronometer
Gives the clock item more purpose by converting it into a pocketwatch!
See the current time and weather by only having it inside your inventory.
